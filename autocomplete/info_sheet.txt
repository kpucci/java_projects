Does your program run without error?: To my knowledge, there are no errors.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:




Additional comments to the grader:
My implementation of the user history includes adding valid dictionary words to the history as well.
I also did not implement the DLB using generics because it added complexity to my user history code.
