I decided to implement my priority queue using a Hashtable for the lookup Car table
and ArrayLists to maintain the queues. I used an ArrayList as opposed to an array so
that I wouldn't have to worry about resizing. An ArrayList was used instead of a
LinkedList because although the add() time can have the extra computation needed to
resize the array, this only happens every so often. Its get() method is always O(1)
due to array indexing, whereas the LinkedList get() method will always be O(n).

A hashtable was used for the lookup table due to its O(1) put(), get(), and remove()
times; however, this is a tradeoff for space. I used two classes - CarPrice and
CarMileage - to handle comparisons of the property values and to hold a reference
to the VIN of the car with which the property is associated.
